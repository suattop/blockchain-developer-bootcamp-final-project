# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

Project idea: a one click farming tool for existing farming pairs. It allows users to supply one asset or stablecoin to do any farming pair.

Workflow:
1. users have to choose the farming pair
2. users choose one asset of the farming pair
3. supply the wanted amount
4. smart contract will trade half of the supplied asset to another asset of the farming pair
5. supply both two assets to the liquidity pool and get LP token
6. supply LP token to the farm
7. That's all.
